     <h1>More about us!</h1>
     <p>Zoe’s Cupcakery was founded by Zoe Dickens in 2019.
        Zoe Dickens started her cupcake business at the young age of 16 but she has been baking since she was 13.
        When Zoe was about 4 she developed a severe allergy to artificial food color so growing up she was never able to enjoy sweets and most foods.
        As Zoe got a little older her mother developed a very severe allergy to soy, nuts, and peanuts, and at the age of 14 Zoe developed a sever allergy to to eggs.
        So what did she do? She learned to bake! Ever since then Zoe’s mission was to bake things for everyone to enjoy!
